Hey! I'm Faioli, aka 0xttfx 

![Im](/thiago_9.png)

After more than 25 years of experience, I think I'm an expert in IT infrastructure, Unix and Linux systems administrator, cloud computing, platform engineer, {S,N} RE, cyber security, geek and üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è  hacker culture enthusiast


I also had the pleasure of being invited by the fearless friend [@coffinix](https://area31.net.br/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:Coffnix) through the master [@cybernetus](https://cybernetus.com) to be a founding member (with the train already moving under the tracks...) of [Area31 Hackerspace - Minas Gerais - Brazil](https://area31.net.br) üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è


This blog is about me, unix, linux, infrastructure, cyber security, hacker culture and what I feel like talking about :)


Have fun at this place and get in touch if you want...
